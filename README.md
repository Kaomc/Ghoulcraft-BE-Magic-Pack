# Ghoulcraft BE ~ Magic Pack

**Ghoulcraft BE** is an Add-On for **Minecraft**. This Pack contains a ton of magical items, perfect for your aspiring witches and cottagecore lovers.

## What is Ghoulcraft BE?

Ghoulcraft BE is the official ported version of [MissGhoul’s Ghoulcraft CIT for Java](https://ghoulcraft.com/). Ghoulcraft BE is a Data-Driven Block Add-On Pack, or also known as a CIM pack. This adds bunch of new blocks and items to use into your world as decorations!

These blocks cannot be interacted with and are for aesthetic use only. This is intended for **Creative** players, there’s no way for the blocks to be obtained in survival without using commands – at the moment.

Ghoulcraft BE’s textures has been recolored to match the popular resource pack [Mizuno Craft](https://bit.ly/3dPTLu6). Ghoulcraft BE can be used with vanilla minecraft but it will not match some of the block’s color.

Some items can be placed with other functional blocks (like chest) and give the illusion that they are functional.

Ghoulcraft BE only works on **Windows 10, Android, & Apple Devices** – Running Minecraft Bedrock/Pocket Edition **1.16.200+ and above**.
